/*
 * The update query is meant to update data within
 * the database using the SQL "Where" function
 * and the Company ID. To follow format, insert
 * terms where there is [] or ''. Do not change
 * [Company ID] unless wanting to search by a 
 * different term. You can narrow down the search
 * by using multiple conditions added to 
 * Where [Company ID] = #
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Update [Contacts]
 * Set [Cell Phone] = '123-456-7890'
 * Where [Company ID] = #, [Contact First Name] = 'Stasha'
 *
 *
 * In a case like [Company ID] = 45, there are two contacts
 * so we would have to narrow down to which contact to update 
 * information to.
